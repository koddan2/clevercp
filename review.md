Code Review: clevercp.nim
I'll review your Nim code for the clevercp utility, which helps minimize network file transfers by tracking file checksums.

Strengths
Well-structured: Clear organization with distinct functions for each command
Good documentation: The help text effectively explains the tool's purpose
Smart approach: Using file hashes to determine which files need copying is efficient
Areas for Improvement
1. Manual String Parsing in readManifest
The manifest file parsing uses manual character-by-character scanning which could be error-prone:

Consider using split with your delimiter:

2. Error Handling
The code frequently uses assert for validation:

For a CLI tool, more graceful error handling would improve user experience:

3. Command Line Parsing
Your custom argument parsing works but could be simplified using parseopt's full capabilities rather than joining args into a single string and reparsing.

4. File Reading Efficiency
getHashOfFile loads the entire file into memory:

For large files, consider a streaming/chunked approach.

5. Progress Indication
The current progress indicator is minimal:

Consider adding percentage completion or a proper progress bar.

6. Code Duplication
copyCommand calls generateManifestCommand but then duplicates some of its parsing logic:

7. Unfinished Features
There are several TODOs in the code:

8. Verbosity Handling
The code has numerous echo "VRB: statements without a way to control verbosity level.

Recommendations
Implement more robust string parsing
Replace assertions with user-friendly error handling
Consider streaming for large file operations
Add proper verbosity control (--quiet, --verbose flags)
Implement better progress indication
Refactor duplicate code
Complete or document the TODOs
Add error handling for file operations
Overall, this is a solid utility with a clear purpose. The suggested improvements would enhance reliability and user experience.
